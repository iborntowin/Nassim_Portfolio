- **Memory leak prevention** through systematic cleanup
- **Performance monitoring** of active animations

## ðŸŽ¯ Specific Optimizations Implemented

### Terminal Component Optimizations
1. **History Management**: Auto-trim terminal lines (100 on mobile, 500 on desktop)
2. **Scroll Optimization**: Debounced scrolling with RAF-based updates
3. **Input Throttling**: Reduced update frequency on low-performance devices
4. **Effect Disabling**: Conditional rendering of expensive effects
5. **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old terminal data

### Mobile-Specific Improvements
1. **Reduced Animations**: Shorter durations and simpler transitions
2. **Disabled Effects**: No particles, glow, or trails on mobile
3. **Optimized Rendering**: Removed backdrop blur and complex filters
4. **Touch Optimization**: Larger touch targets and better gesture handling
5. **Keyboard Handling**: Proper viewport adjustments for virtual keyboards

### Performance Thresholds
- **FPS Target**: 60 FPS (fallbacks trigger at <45 FPS)
- **Memory Limit**: 75% heap usage triggers cleanup
- **Render Time**: <16.67ms per frame (60 FPS target)
- **History Limits**: 100 lines (mobile), 500 lines (desktop)
- **Animation Limits**: Max 10 concurrent animations

## ðŸ“Š Testing & Validation

### Mobile Test Suite (`mobile-test-suite.tsx`)
- **Device Detection Tests**: Verify mobile/tablet identification
- **Touch Support Validation**: Check touch event capabilities
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure touch response and scroll FPS
- **Viewport Testing**: Validate safe area and keyboard handling
- **Compatibility Checks**: Ensure proper mobile optimizations

### Performance Metrics Tracked
- **Frames Per Second**: Real-time FPS monitoring
- **Memory Usage**: Heap size and garbage collection
- **Render Time**: Time per frame calculation
- **DOM Complexity**: Node count and animation tracking
- **Touch Response**: Touch event latency measurement

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Fallback Configuration
```typescript
{
  enableFallbacks: true,
  fallbackThresholds: {
    fps: 45,           // Below 45 FPS triggers fallbacks
    memoryUsage: 75,   // Above 75% memory usage
    renderTime: 20     // Above 20ms render time
  }
}
```

### Mobile Settings
```typescript
{
  enableAnimations: false,      // Disabled on mobile
  enableParticles: false,       // Disabled on mobile
  enableGlow: false,           // Disabled on mobile
  maxHistoryLines: 100,        // Reduced for mobile
  updateInterval: 100          // Slower updates on mobile
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Optimizations

### Conditional Rendering
- **Effects disabled** on mobile devices
- **Simplified animations** on low-end devices
- **Reduced visual complexity** during performance issues
